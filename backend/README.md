Here's a summary of what is covered here:

1. Server Configuration:

The server.js file sets up your Express server, connects to MongoDB, and listens for incoming HTTP requests.

2. Routes:

Authentication-related routes (/api/auth/register and /api/auth/login) are defined in authRoutes.js.
Task-related routes (/api/tasks) for CRUD operations are defined in taskRoutes.js.

3. Controllers:

authController.js contains controller functions for handling user registration and login.
taskController.js contains controller functions for CRUD operations on tasks.

4. Models:

User.js defines the Mongoose model for the User collection.
Task.js defines the Mongoose model for the Task collection.

5. Middleware:

authMiddleware.js contains middleware functions, such as authenticateToken, for authentication.
